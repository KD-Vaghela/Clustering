## Clustering and Topic Modeling
In this project, different text clustering methods (K-means, Gaussian mixture, LDA) are used to label a document appropriately. 
- `Train_Data.csv`: This file contains a list of documents. It's used for training models
- `Test_Data.cvs`: This file contains a list of documents and their ground-truth labels (4 lables: 1,2,3 7). It's used for external evaluation.
